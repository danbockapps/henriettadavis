            Brief Bio
          </h2>


<p>
Henrietta Davis is the former mayor of Cambridge and long-time city 
councilor. In January 2014, she retired from elective office after serving on the 
City Council for 18 years, ending her service in the position of mayor. She is a 
member of the Cambridge net zero task force. In addition, she currently serves on 
the board of MCAN (the Mass Climate Action Network), the board of USGBC-MA (the 
green building council) and is a member of that organization's net zero 
committee. She is also on the board of the Institute for Market Transformation, a 
national organization promoting energy efficiency in buildings. Henrietta 
attended the Paris Climate Talks and became more convinced than ever that it's up 
to cities and states to take action. Further that they should begin with the 
built environment: 40% of carbon emissions in the US come from buildings. 82% of 
Cambridge carbon emissions come from buildings!
