          <h2>Henrietta's Kickoff Announcement and Press Release</h2>

          <p>
            Henrietta Davis announces: She's a candidate for Democratic State
            Committee Woman!
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm excited to announce that I'm running for Democratic State
            Committee Woman, to help make a difference in this critical
            presidential election year. I want to bring together Democrats to
            actively campaign for candidates who will protect women's rights,
            LGBTQ rights, civil rights and voting rights, and promote true
            democratic values.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to tell you about who I am and my record of accomplishment.
            As mayor of Cambridge, and in my many years as an elected official
            there, I went all out to see that we in Massachusetts were national
            leaders in children and family health, in addressing climate change
            and in providing solutions for housing at all income levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a policy person and a strong believer in democratic values--in
            making government work for the people, in fairness and for
            participation in government. I always work collaboratively and
            strategically to get things done. That's what I plan to do as
            Democratic State Committee Woman.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am proud to have Senator Sal DiDomenico's support as I run for
            this seat which represents his Senate district, Middlesex and
            Suffolk. It is made up of the eastern end of Cambridge, and all of
            Chelsea, Everett and Charlestown. It's a wonderfully diverse
            district, and a microcosm of the state. I am certain that MassDems
            need to hear more about the issues and opportunities that confront
            people across this district. And MassDems also need to become more
            connected to the hard- working organizations that are helping our
            families, communities and businesses thrive. I pledge to work hard
            to be that link for the Middlesex and Suffolk district.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have lots of work ahead to ensure a robust social safety net, to
            answer urgent housing needs, to create jobs and opportunities for
            workers to afford to remain in our state. We also need to reduce
            carbon emissions and increase alternative energy resources, to
            protect people from the effects of climate change. There is an
            urgent need to address the needs of new immigrants. These are all
            priorities for me. I ask for your vote on March 5 (or before if you
            vote by mail.) I would be honored to serve you and look forward to
            hearing your priorities for our district.

            Brief Bio
          </h2>

          <p>
            Henrietta Davis is the former mayor of Cambridge and was a long-time
            city councilor. In January 2014, she retired from elective office
            after serving on the City Council for 18 years, ending her service
            in the position of mayor. As mayor, she focused her efforts on
            climate action, family and children's health, and pedestrian and
            bicycle safety. After serving as mayor, she was a member of the
            Cambridge Net Zero Task Force. In addition, she served on the board
            of MCAN (the Mass Climate Action Network), and the board of USGBC-MA
            (the green building council). She was also on the board of the
            Institute for Market Transformation, a national organization
            promoting energy efficiency in buildings. Henrietta attended the
            Paris Climate Talks and became more convinced than ever that it's up
            to cities and states to take action!
          </p>

          <h2>
            Bio
          </h2>

          <p>
            Henrietta Davis served as the Mayor of the City of Cambridge for two
            years, from 2012 to January 2014. Prior to that she served eight
            terms on the Cambridge City Council, twice as the City's Vice Mayor.
            She also served on the School Committee for ten years. As Mayor she
            was its chair.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over two decades serving the City of Cambridge, Mayor Davis focused
            on creating a healthy and livable city, concentrating not only on
            energy and the environment, but also on pedestrian and bicycling
            safety, neighborhood preservation, housing, aging in Cambridge, and
            children's health and education.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mayor Davis made collaboration between the city's universities,
            businesses and the Cambridge community a hallmark of her term as
            mayor. In Cambridge, a hub of the global knowledge-based economy,
            Mayor Davis convened all sectors of the community for urban
            planning, sustainable development, and science and technology-based
            workforce development (STEAM).
          </p>

          <p>
            As mayor, she took the lead to found the Cambridge Compact for a
            Sustainable Future, a collaboration between MIT, Harvard and many of
            the city's leading businesses in the knowledge- based economy. This
            group committed to working together to address climate change,
            especially by addressing energy use in buildings. She was also a
            member of the Cambridge Net Zero Task Force, a municipal advisory
            committee developing a long-term plan to reduce carbon emissions,
            aiming for zero emissions through energy efficiency and generation
            of renewable energy and many other measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to serving as mayor, for many years Mayor Davis was the Chair
            of the City Council's Environment Committee and she led the Council
            to adopt a Green Building policy for all new city buildings. Because
            of her efforts all new school buildings are built to net zero
            standards. One such school, the Tobin School, is now under
            construction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mayor Davis also worked on many policy initiatives to improve the
            lives of families and children. For twenty-five years she co-chaired
            the national award-winning Healthy Children's Task Force, a
            community collaboration that was an early and successful promoter of
            healthy eating and physical activity for children. As Mayor, she
            chaired the Cambridge Kids' Council, the coordinating council for
            children and families.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond Cambridge, Mayor Davis has been involved with national,
            state, and international activities. Mayor Davis served as the Chair
            of the International Council at the National League of Cities (NLC),
            and she was past Chair of NLC's Energy, Environment and Natural
            Resources Committee. At NLC she also chaired the University
            Community Relations Committee. She was a member of the Massachusetts
            Municipal Association's Energy and Environmental Policy Committee
            She has served on the board of the Institute for Market
            Transformation(IMT.) Former Mayor Davis has spoken on sustainability
            initiatives here and abroad.
          </p>

          <p>
            Educational background: Henrietta Davis graduated from the
            University of Rochester, holds a Master's Degree from Boston College
            Graduate School of Social Work, and a Master's in Public
            Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
